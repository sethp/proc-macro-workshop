error[E0382]: use of moved value: `builder`
  --> tests/10-use-once.rs:16:5
   |
12 |     let builder = Command::builder();
   |         ------- move occurs because `builder` has type `CommandBuilder`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
13 |
14 |     let _ = builder.build();
   |                     ------- `builder` moved due to this method call
15 |
16 |     builder.build();
   |     ^^^^^^^ value used here after move
   |
note: this function takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `builder`
  --> tests/10-use-once.rs:3:10
   |
3  | #[derive(Builder)]
   |          ^^^^^^^
   = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Builder` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
